# trmxlx2nmea
it's a python script for convert Trimble xlx format file into NMEA (GGA) format file

some customer claim that they only have a evaluation tools on NMEA format file, 
for our Trimlbe autonomy B5000 unit, it can only output xlx file, this script may help, 
currently it just a draft version, not tested by those tools yet.

. it's a windows base script
. install python
. install openpyxl (pip install openpyxl)
. save xlx as xlsx (openpyxl can only parse xlsx format)
. run it (xlx2nmea.exe)
